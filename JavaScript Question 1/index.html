    <h4>What is the output of the following code and why?</h4>
    <p>for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        setTimeout(function() {
          console.log(i);
        }, 1000);
      }
      </p><br>
      <p>Answer:
        The output will be 3 3 3.
        <br><br>
        Explanation:
        The setTimeout function creates a closure that captures the variable i by reference, not by value. By the time the setTimeout callbacks execute, the loop has already completed and i is 3.
        
        To fix this and log 0 1 2, you can use let instead of var, which creates a block-scoped variable:</p>
    <script src="index.js"></script>
